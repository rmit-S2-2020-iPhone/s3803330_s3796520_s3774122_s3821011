# Prototype

Overall Implementation and Ease of Use
- [ ] 1.) The app is NOT confusing and/or difficult to use.
- [ ] 2.) The app DOES NOT lead to situations where the user cannot back out and therefore must restart the app.
- [ ] 3.) The app DOES NOT include features that are only partially implemented or not implemented at all.
- [ ] 4.) No significant issues were identified during assessment that were related to the use of the app.

Functional Navigation
- [ ] 1.) The app DOES NOT have segues that are non functional.
- [ ] 2.) All features in the app are complete and any unfinished features have been removed in the final version prior to submission.
- [ ] 3.) All scenes show complete and correct data.
- [ ] 4.) There are no aspects of the app that interferes with the successful running of the app.

Auto Layout
- [ ] 1. There are no constraint conflicts present in the storyboard. 
- [ ] 2. Manual constraints have been used to demonstrated to achieve the layout requirements. 
- [ ] 3. At least two scenes have utilised manual constraint-based design without making use of stack views. 
- [ ] 4. Any prototype cells or custom cells in a UITableView make use of constraints to layout out each row.

Design Themes & Principles
- [ ] All scenes in the prototype have implemented best practice in design according to the design principles and themes taught in the course.
- [ ] Each of the four design principles and three design themes have been consciously applied to the design and function of each scene.

Design Patterns (Object Oriented)
- [ ] 1. You must design and implement the design pattern in your code, not make use of one already implemented by a library or framework.
- [ ] 2. At least one design pattern in addition to MVVM and/or Singleton has been implemented.
- [ ] 3. POSTGRADUATE ONLY - Research component
         Students must research, design and implement the coordinator pattern as the basis for your apps architecture.
- [ ] 4. POSTGRADUATE ONLY students must provide a detailed description of the coordinator pattern, its intent, its architecture and the benefits of the pattern.          This must also include a mapping between the identified components of the architecture and the class/structs/enums that have been used to implement those components. You must also indicate choices and decisions you had to make in designing the pattern and provide justification for why you made the decisions.

Persistence
- [ ] 1.) You must mock up the creation of data.
- [ ] 2.) You must mock-up the retrieval of data.
- [ ] 3.) You must mock-up the ability to update/change data.
- [ ] 4.) You must mock-up the deletion of data.
- [ ] 5.) POSTGRADUATE ONLY students must implement a database structure that includes relationships between tables such as a parent / child relationship.

Networking (REST)
- [ ] 1.) You must mock-up the display of data from your REST API with sample data that reflects real data from the API.
- [ ] 2.) The data should be stored in a specific format in memory and then be processed by your app for display, this should not just be displaying data on a scene.
- [ ] 3.) You must implement Application Transport Security explicitly.

Code Elegance
- [ ] 1. Data is represented as objects based on enums, structs and classes as appropriate. For example representing data as hard coded strings is not acceptable.
- [ ] 2. Appropriate use of access control has been used. For example: if a member of a class is only accessed from within that class it should be marked as private.
- [ ] 3. Functions make use of various features in Swift to make the code easy to read and self-documenting.
- [ ] 4. All classes, structs, enums and functions are cohesive and modular.
- [ ] 5. Code is appropriately commented. For example: No unused code is left in the solution as commented.
- [ ] 6. The project hierarchy is well organised into folders to make code easy to find.

Project Planning & Management
- [ ] 1.) Your contribution form and your weekly logs demonstrate a review of each team memberâ€™s contributions.
- [ ] 2.) You have organised to meet with your instructor during the assessment period to demonstrate progress and get feedback on any difficulties.
- [ ] 3.) The repository has pull requests that demonstrates team members have been involved in reviewing and merging features from other team members back into the main branch.
